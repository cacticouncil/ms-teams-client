# Tokens

Throught this reverse engineering effort, we have found multiple tokens in use by the Microsoft Teams webapp. However, there are only a few that are required for basic operation.

## Skype Token

Ah yes. It wouldn't be the Microsoft Way&trade; without pushing Skype into random stuff.

## Chat Service Token
Known in code as `chatSvcAggToken` (we have yet to figure out what `Agg` is).
