THIS CODE IS NOT USED ANYWHERE, our application does not depend on it in any way. It is here for RECORD-KEEPING purposses ONLY.

This started as an effort to trasnlate the electron login into C++ and failed (As of FALL 2021 Semester)

Currently this code depends on:
1.  https://github.com/libcpr/cpr to make C++ requests
2.  https://github.com/nlohmann/json for parsing json strings in C++ 
3.  https://renenyffenegger.ch/notes/development/Base64/Encoding-and-decoding-base-64-with-cpp/ for decoding base 64 with C++
